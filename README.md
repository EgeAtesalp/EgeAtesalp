### Hi there 	:wave:

My Name is Ege Atesalp. I am a software developer living in Berlin, and I am especially passionate for Data Science, as well as Blockchain Networks and their ecosystems. I graduated from Technical University Berlin (here is [my bachelor_thesis](Bachelor_Thesis.pdf) :nerd_face:, its about CI/CD and DevOps implementations for ML applications). Feel free to contact me for any questions, inquiries via egeatesalp@gmail.com.
